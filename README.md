# KStrength
 A simple password strength calculator. No passwords are saved or shown to me in any way.
 
 The different levels of strength and their criteria are as follows:
 
 WEAK - Password is shorter than 8 characters
 
 MEDIUM - Password is 8 characters or longer
 
 STRONG - (MEDIUM), Password has at least two "special characters" (Numbers AND Symbols)
 
 EXTREME - (STRONG), Password is 17 characters or longer
 
 
 To use the password checker, simply input the password into the textfield and press 'Enter'.
